/*
Exercise 1 - Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
*/

//My solution:
let hashTag = '';
for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  hashTag += '#';
  console.log(hashTag);
}

//EJ solution:
for (let line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#")
  console.log(line);

/*
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
*/

//My solution:
for (let num = 1; num <= 100; num++) {
  if (num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz'); 
  } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
    console.log('Fizz');
  } else if (num % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('Buzz');
  } else {
    console.log(num);

//EJ Solution:
for (let n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
  let output = "";
  if (n % 3 == 0) output += "Fizz";
  if (n % 5 == 0) output += "Buzz";

/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/

//My solution:
let size = 8;
const chessBoard = function (size) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
    let output = '';
    let firstLine = ' #';
    let secondLine = '# ';
    for (let j = 2; j <= size; j += 2) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        output += secondLine;
      } else {
        output += firstLine;
      }
    }
    output += '\n';
    console.log(output);
  }
};

chessBoard(size);

//EJ solution:
let size = 8;
let board = "";

for (let y = 0; y < size; y++) {
  for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
    if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
      board += " ";
    } else {
      board += "#";
    }

  board += "\n";

console.log(board);
