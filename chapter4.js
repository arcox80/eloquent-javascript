/*
let journal = [];
function addEntry(events, squirrel) {
  journal.push({events, squirrel});
}

Note that the object added to the journal looks a little odd. Instead of declaring properties like 
events: events, it just gives a property name. This is shorthand that means the same thing—if a property 
name in brace notation isn’t followed by a value, its value is taken from the binding with the same name.
